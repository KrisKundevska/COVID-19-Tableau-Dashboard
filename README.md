Retrospective

Project Name: COVID-19 Tableau Dashboard

Summary:
The COVID-19 Tableau Dashboard project was created in a class setting using a COVID-19 dataset. The goal was to visualize and analyze COVID-19 data efficiently and effectively.

What Went Well:

Data Visualization: The dashboard successfully leveraged Tableau for data visualization, providing clear and interactive charts, maps, and reports.

Timely Insights: Despite time constraints, the project enabled timely access to COVID-19 data and valuable insights for understanding the pandemic's impact.

Interactive Features: The dashboard was interactive, allowing users to explore data, apply filters, and gain insights dynamically.

Basic Data Analysis: Despite the limited time, the dashboard effectively presented basic data analysis to help understand the trends.

What Could Be Improved:

Complex Analysis: Given more time, exploring and presenting more complex and in-depth data analysis could provide a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 situation.

Data Quality: Ensuring the quality of the dataset used is crucial for accurate analysis. Addressing data cleaning and validation would enhance the project's reliability.

Documentation: Providing clear and comprehensive documentation for the dashboard, including data sources and methodology, would assist in understanding and replicating the work.

Lessons Learned:

Data Visualization: Gained hands-on experience with Tableau for data visualization, a valuable skill for presenting complex data.

Data Analysis: Developed basic data analysis skills, including creating interactive dashboards for easy insights.

Data Quality Matters: Realized the importance of clean and accurate data for reliable analysis and visualization.

Future Steps:

For future dashboard projects, I plan to focus on data quality and documentation, delve into more complex data analysis, and allocate more time for comprehensive projects. Learning from this experience, I aim to create more in-depth and impactful data visualizations.

This COVID-19 Tableau Dashboard project was a valuable opportunity to apply data visualization skills to real-world data, even with time constraints. It highlighted the significance of clean data and documentation for accurate analysis.
